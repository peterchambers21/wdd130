        <h3 class="recipe-header">Cheesy Broccoli Soup by Becky Cornwall</h3>
        <p class="recipe-ingridients">
            2 onions, chopped<br>
            3 cups broccoli, chopped<br>
            3 cloves garlic, crushed<br>
            1 Tbsp olive oil<br>
            1 quart chicken broth, canned or homemade<br>
            1 cup low-fat cheddar cheese, shredded
            1 cup skim milk
        </p>
        <p class="recipe-instructions">In a large soup pot, saute onions and garlic until wilted. Add chopped broccoli and continue cooking. Pour broth over the top and cook until broccoli is very tender, about 30 minutes. In batches, process soup through a food processor or blender until smooth. Add milk and let continue cooking another 20 minutes, but be careful not to let boil or the soup will separate. When nice and thick, remove from heat and serve in individual bowls. Top each bowl with <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup cheese and serve with a big salad and whole-grain bread.</p>
